      <description>Just stumbled on to a article in Medium.com which is related to the current title.
It just got me thinking about what I might need to do with my digital estates/assets.
Using the search engine, I stumble upon various articles that covers this very topic. The following links do cover the various thoughts and concerns that people have thought of. I personally do favor the last 2 links for less marketed and more general opinions towards the topic.</description>

      <description>Had a read on Medium this morning and saw an article that relates to autonomous driving.
Eon uses Comma.AI OpenPilot project to help automate your vehicle. You have to hook it up to your vehicle&amp;rsquo;s CAN bus/ODB2 system to allow it to detect and maneuver the vehicle for you, this is only possible if your vehicle has Adaptive Cruise Control. Eon uses a front facing dashcam to capture what is happening on the road in front of your vehicle and the algorithm will do it&amp;rsquo;s job in telling the vehicle what to do.</description>
